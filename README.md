# screencovid.com
Please contribute. This project is based off a phone call I had with Sajung Yun, PhD. He is very much interested in saving lives, and has analyzed the data available to come up with a simple formula for a screener.  He created a screening tool, but it wasn't a mobile friendly UX. You can see what he's put together at https://www.screencovid.org/ . The goal is to get this tool production ready by Mon 3/23 so Dr. Yun can share with the media. 

The domain is hosted on github pages, screencovid.com is pointed to the /docs folder in this repository

You can view his findings and rationale behind the screening at https://github.com/tconley/screencovid.com/raw/master/Presentation_Prescreencovid_v9_03202020.pdf

# How can you help?
* Images (free for public use) for each symptom
* enhance the UX so users can also click YES/NO on the edges of the swipe area
* Alert the user when they are over the 212 threshold
* anything else you have in mind!
* create a contributors page to give credit to anyone that helps

#Recommendations based on symptoms
There are 3 thresholds listed in the PDF. Dr. Yun is consulting with the medical community about these 3 tiers, so for now he wants to advise any score greater than 212 to consult with a doctor.  Regardless, app should have functionality for the 3 different alert levels, as that will be decided upon in the next few days.
* > 212 = Doctor consultation
* > 260 = COVID-19 Testing recommended
* > 316.4 = Fast-Track COVID-19 testing
